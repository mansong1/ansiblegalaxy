Documentation source for Galaxy 
==============================

Contains the source behind [galaxy.ansible.com/docs](https://galaxy.ansible.com/docs)

Contributions to documentation are welcome. To make changes, submit a pull request that changes the reStructuredText files found the in the `rst/` directory only, and the Galaxy team will build and push the static files.

If you wish to verify output from the markup, such as link references, you may install [sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html) and the required theme, and then build the documentation locally.

The following uses `pip` to install sphinx, and the theme:
```
pip install sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme
```

Run the following to build the documentation:
```
# Within the Galaxy project tree, set your working directory to docs/docsite
$ cd docs/docsite

# Build a local copy of the static files
$ make webdocs

# Open the site in your default browser
$ open _build/html/index.html
```

If you do not want to learn the reStructuredText format, you can also [file an issue](https://github.com/ansible/galaxy/issues), and let us know how we can improve our documentation.
